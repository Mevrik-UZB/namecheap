1. What kinds of DNS records do you know, and why is each of them needed?
2. What is a routing table? How can you add records to it?
3. Which console commands\utilities do you usually use to check server state and perform basic troubleshooting steps?
4. You need to update the kernel on 100 servers. How do you complete this task?
5. Please explain the following string:
(date ; ps -ef | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l ) >> Activity.log


ANSWERS: 

1. Name server record. It contains primary and secondary servers.

2. Routing table - data packets traveling over a IP network will be directed. All IP-enabled devices, including routers and switches, use routing tables.

example:
destination		subnet mask			interface
192.168.1.0		255.255.255.192		Eth0
192.168.2.64	255.255.255.192		Eth1
.... 

Each interface has their unique static/DHCP IP.

3. Commands: 
cat /proc/*       -> Various Linux kernel statistics
cat /proc/meminfo -> memory information, used and free spaces.
mpstat            -> check each of the available CPUs on a multi-process. Basically, CPU status
netstat -a | more -> network status. port or interface activated
ps / ps -la       -> currently running processes
top               -> CPU intensive task running, what`s going on with active processes
vmstat -m/a       -> virtual memory monitor

4. Shell script. For the main server, I would download the latest kernel as a *.deb (for Ubuntu) or *.rom (for Linux). Share it with all servers with script.
Second script is for crontab. In every managed time, crontab shell script execute installing, updating, changing and rebooting 

Other alternative way, Ansible, awx and git. All of my configuration files are in the git repository.
Making a change to them triggers a ci pipeline on awx that them runs a playback to deploy the changes. Because of the idempotent nature of anisble, only the thing that I've changed gets updated. For certain high risk changes a test group of 10 servers gets the change first, if all is good, then it gets blasted out.

There might be a problem with SSH, but I have not faced yet. If this occurs, then I have to manually log into the console of 100 servers.

5. (date ; ps -ef | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l ) >> Activity.log
date: Shows the current date time.
ps -ef: currently running processes with UID contains the username.
awk '{print $1}' : print the first column og the previous command and save it to Activity.log
sort : alphabetic sort, applies to ps-ef command
uniq : find uniq lines in a given input, report/removes the duplicated lines
wc -l : prints the number of lines present in a file, Activity.log

Finally the output of the whole command will be saved on Activity.log file
Executing multiple shell scripts at once.
